# The One Probe (TOP) - Minecraft Mod
_More immersive alternative for WAILA_

## What is this fork?

This is a server version of TOP that allows clients with TOP to use the overlay and clients without TOP to connect to the server. Do not use this on a client. This will only work on a dedicated server (running the minecraft server jar), using the MC integrated server (the server provided by the client) is impossible. This is because I deleted a lot of client side code that the server will simply never use. I made this change only because my friends installed HWYLA and I didn't want to force them to install TOP to join the server. Yes, I'd rather spend an hour of my time changing code than have to deal with people installing one mod LOL.
